# NYC-OpenData

#### The Challenge:
Build an Android app that uses data from NYC OpenData to display motor vehicle collision information on a map.

#### What To Do:
Use the data to display collisions as points on a map can be found [here](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/NYC-BigApps/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95?).

Tapping a point should bring up an overlay containing information about the collision.

The data can be accessed using a RESTful API.  If you visit BLANK, you can see how to use the API if you click the "Export" button, and then expand the "SODA API".  An example request to get all data would be:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json

Be as creative as you like with the user interface, but keep Android design principles and best practices in mind.
